# Traffic Sign Recognition ‚Äì CNN vs MobileNetV2

##  Description
This project implements a **Traffic Sign Recognition system** using the **GTSRB (German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark) dataset**.  
It is part of the **Self-Paced Elevvo Machine Learning Internship (Industry-Level Project)**.  

The notebook compares two approaches for classifying traffic signs:  
1. **Custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** ‚Äì built from scratch.  
2. **MobileNetV2 (Pretrained Model)** ‚Äì fine-tuned for traffic sign classification.

##  Features
- Image preprocessing and normalization  
- Data augmentation for better generalization  
- Two model approaches:
  - Custom CNN  
  - MobileNetV2 (transfer learning)  
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  
- Visual performance comparison between models  

---

##  Project Workflow
1. **Dataset Loading and Analysis**  
   - [GTSRB dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign)  
   - Images resized and normalized  

2. **Data Preprocessing & Augmentation**  
   - Applied transformations (rotation, zoom, shifts)  

3. **Model Development**  
   - Custom CNN with convolution, pooling, dropout, and dense layers  
   - MobileNetV2 pretrained on ImageNet and fine-tuned  

4. **Training & Validation**  
   - Trained both models with early stopping and validation tracking  

5. **Evaluation**  
   - Compared class-wise **precision, recall, and F1-score**

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

* The **Custom CNN** performed well overall but showed weaknesses in some classes, especially rare or complex signs.
* The **MobileNetV2 model** consistently outperformed the custom CNN with **higher accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scores**.
* This shows that **transfer learning with pretrained models is more effective** for real-world problems like traffic sign recognition.
* In practical applications such as **autonomous driving**, this higher accuracy can directly improve safety and reliability.
